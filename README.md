# MultiplayerGameRoom

## How it works
1. User keys in session code and username
2. User either creates or join existing room.
3. Any changes made by any users in the existing room will be seen and updated live for all other players in the same session.

## How to get started
1. Open up a new terminal in your desired folder and run "npm create vite@latest"
2. Give the project name "MultiplayerGame" or any desired project name
3. Select Vanilla framework and vanilla (avoid typescript)
4. cd MultiplayerGame (or whatever project name you used)
5. npm install
6. Go into the folder where the new Vite files have been created.
7. Download these GitHub repo files and replace the index.html file. Place the other files into the new created folder
8. npm run dev
9. Click on the localhost link and see the files ready for you code along! You can watch the video here to follow along.

## Side note
The CSS and HTML files are ready to be used, but there's no Javascript files to run the application in the main folder.  If you want the final product instead, don't use the first files you see here. For step 7, extract the files from semi-completed folder to replace the index.HTML files and add on 3 other new files.
